This is a small exploration of how Markdown could be modified to better support
custom HTML elements. Syntax for loading elements and for HTML templates has
been adding. The template syntax doesn't do much, admittedly.

For some thoughts that went into this, see [docs/thoughts.md](docs/thoughts.md).

Note that I'm trying to solve a problem here. I'm just playing with an idea.
